<h2><a id="link2H_4_0002"></a>
      CHAPTER I.<br>The Period
    </h2>
<p>
      It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of
      wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was
      the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season
      of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we
      had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going
      direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way—in short,
      the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest
      authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the
      superlative degree of comparison only.
    </p>
<p>
      There were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face, on the
      throne of England; there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a
      fair face, on the throne of France. In both countries it was clearer than
      crystal to the lords of the State preserves of loaves and fishes, that
      things in general were settled for ever.
    </p>
<p>
      It was the year of Our Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five.
      Spiritual revelations were conceded to England at that favoured period, as
      at this. Mrs. Southcott had recently attained her five-and-twentieth
      blessed birthday, of whom a prophetic private in the Life Guards had
      heralded the sublime appearance by announcing that arrangements were made
      for the swallowing up of London and Westminster. Even the Cock-lane ghost
      had been laid only a round dozen of years, after rapping out its messages,
      as the spirits of this very year last past (supernaturally deficient in
      originality) rapped out theirs. Mere messages in the earthly order of
      events had lately come to the English Crown and People, from a congress of
      British subjects in America: which, strange to relate, have proved more
      important to the human race than any communications yet received through
      any of the chickens of the Cock-lane brood.
    </p>
<p>
      France, less favoured on the whole as to matters spiritual than her sister
      of the shield and trident, rolled with exceeding smoothness down hill,
      making paper money and spending it. Under the guidance of her Christian
      pastors, she entertained herself, besides, with such humane achievements
      as sentencing a youth to have his hands cut off, his tongue torn out with
      pincers, and his body burned alive, because he had not kneeled down in the
      rain to do honour to a dirty procession of monks which passed within his
      view, at a distance of some fifty or sixty yards. It is likely enough
      that, rooted in the woods of France and Norway, there were growing trees,
      when that sufferer was put to death, already marked by the Woodman, Fate,
      to come down and be sawn into boards, to make a certain movable framework
      with a sack and a knife in it, terrible in history. It is likely enough
      that in the rough outhouses of some tillers of the heavy lands adjacent to
      Paris, there were sheltered from the weather that very day, rude carts,
      bespattered with rustic mire, snuffed about by pigs, and roosted in by
      poultry, which the Farmer, Death, had already set apart to be his tumbrils
      of the Revolution. But that Woodman and that Farmer, though they work
      unceasingly, work silently, and no one heard them as they went about with
      muffled tread: the rather, forasmuch as to entertain any suspicion that
      they were awake, was to be atheistical and traitorous.
    </p>
<p>
      In England, there was scarcely an amount of order and protection to
      justify much national boasting. Daring burglaries by armed men, and
      highway robberies, took place in the capital itself every night; families
      were publicly cautioned not to go out of town without removing their
      furniture to upholsterers’ warehouses for security; the highwayman in the
      dark was a City tradesman in the light, and, being recognised and
      challenged by his fellow-tradesman whom he stopped in his character of
      “the Captain,” gallantly shot him through the head and rode away; the mail
      was waylaid by seven robbers, and the guard shot three dead, and then got
      shot dead himself by the other four, “in consequence of the failure of his
      ammunition:” after which the mail was robbed in peace; that magnificent
      potentate, the Lord Mayor of London, was made to stand and deliver on
      Turnham Green, by one highwayman, who despoiled the illustrious creature
      in sight of all his retinue; prisoners in London gaols fought battles with
      their turnkeys, and the majesty of the law fired blunderbusses in among
      them, loaded with rounds of shot and ball; thieves snipped off diamond
      crosses from the necks of noble lords at Court drawing-rooms; musketeers
      went into St. Giles’s, to search for contraband goods, and the mob fired
      on the musketeers, and the musketeers fired on the mob, and nobody thought
      any of these occurrences much out of the common way. In the midst of them,
      the hangman, ever busy and ever worse than useless, was in constant
      requisition; now, stringing up long rows of miscellaneous criminals; now,
      hanging a housebreaker on Saturday who had been taken on Tuesday; now,
      burning people in the hand at Newgate by the dozen, and now burning
      pamphlets at the door of Westminster Hall; to-day, taking the life of an
      atrocious murderer, and to-morrow of a wretched pilferer who had robbed a
      farmer’s boy of sixpence.
    </p><p>
      “It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done; it is a
      far, far better rest that I go to than I have ever known.”

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™

easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation

        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue

        receipt of the work.
    </li>
    <li>• You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.

the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.
</div><div>
1.F.
</div><div>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div><div>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div><div>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div><div>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div><div>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div><div>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div><div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.
</div><div>
The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div><div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div><div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div><div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div><div>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div><div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div><div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div><div>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
